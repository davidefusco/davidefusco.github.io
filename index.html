<p>I'm the China tech correspondent for the Financial Times in Beijing.</p>
<p>I'm particularly interested in investigations, and in China’s tech policy, censorship, civil society, and labour issues. 
</p>
<p>
I was raised in the UK and moved to Beijing in 2016. You can reach me on Twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/YuanfenYang">@YuanFenYang</a>.

Here are a few examples of stories I’ve written, as of March 2019:

<ul>
<li>(2019/03) <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/adaa462a-4f61-11e9-9c76-bf4a0ce37d49">Small cracks in China's Great Firewall</a> — one of my regular Tech World columns for the FT Magazine, on how an app launched by the propaganda ministry sparked ridicule — and a rare public discussion about censorship on Microsoft's GitHub platform</li>
<li>(2019/02) <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/fd087484-2f23-11e9-8744-e7016697f225">Inside China's crackdown on young Marxists</a> — a feature-length cover story for the FT Magazine on why a wave of university students at China's top univerisites have rallied for workers' rights, and why the government has taken more than 50 of them into detention</li>
<li>
(2018/08) <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/1416a056-833b-11e7-94e2-c5b903247afd">Supply chains: the dirty secret of China’s prisons</a> — an investigation into prisoners being forced to produce goods for illegal export, for which I traced a garlic delivery truck from a detention centre to an exporter's warehouse
</li><li>(2018/04) <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/dae2c548-4226-11e8-93cf-67ac3a6482fd"> The quiet revolution: China’s millennial backlash</a> — a feature story centred on the lives of three young Chinese women and their personal rebellions against familial expectations
</li><li>(2017/11) <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/7cb56786-cda1-11e7-b781-794ce08b24dc"> Apple’s iPhone X assembled by illegal student labour</a> — an investigation into forced labour in Apple’s supply chain, for which I interviewed wokrers at a Foxconn factory over a number of days. Following this report, Apple and Foxconn ended the years-long practice of forcing students to work at this plant, where the majority of the world's iPhones are assembled.

</p>
<p>
Apart from writing articles I also write poetry and short stories.
</p>
<p> I think of my poetry the same way I think of my journalism: as non-fiction. In my poetry, I strive for emotional clarity. I write about family, politics, China, sex, gender, and growing up disjointedly in several cultures.</p>
<p> I was one of the six London Laureates selected by <a href="https://www.spreadtheword.org.uk/projects/young-peoples-laureate/">Spread the Word</a> from 2015-16. I was a member of the <a href="https://www.barbican.org.uk/take-part/young-creatives/young-poets">Barbican Young Poets</a> from 2014-15. I cut my teeth with the <a href="http://www.writingsquad.com/">Yorkshire Writing Squad</a> from 2007-11, and still feel like all of my poetry originates in a way from some classroom in Sheffield.

<p>From May 2018 I've worked to advance media freedoms as Vice-President of the <a href="http://www.fccchina.org/"> Foreign Correspondents' Community of China</a>.</p>

<p>In a past life I was an economist and a campaigner. I co-founded <a href="https://www.rethinkeconomics.org/"> Rethinking Economics</a>, a UK-headquartered charity that campaigns for more diverse economics education in universities worldwide.
</p>
<h2 id="speaking">speaking</h2>
<p>If you prefer audio to text, I take part fairly regularly in the BBC World Service's hour-long Business Matters show, which is a breakfast show (if you're in China) or a late night show (if you're in the UK). Here's <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/sounds/play/w172wmws9zrcks9">one episode</a> in which I discuss Iran sanctions and peaceful protest.</p>
<p>I'm happy to come talk at your school, non-profit or conference if you think I'd be a good fit and it's for a good cause: email me.</p>
You can hear me talk about the Rethinking Economics campaign on the New Economics Foundation's <a href="https://soundcloud.com/weeklyeconomicspodcast/rethinkingeconomics">Weekly Economics Podcast</a>. You can also listen to me discuss Rethinking Economics on BBC Radio 4 with <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b04svjbj">Aditya Chakrabortty</a>, and again with <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b074zgr2">Peter Day</a>.
