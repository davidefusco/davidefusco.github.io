<div id="about me"><h2 id="about me">aboutme</h2> 
I'm a former hospitality professional and business owner turned
UX Designer. The CareerFoundry UX course has inspired me to
bring my passion for understanding and satisfying customer needs
into the digital world. My portfolio focuses on responsible design
and extensive research; in the first I built some key features for a
mobile app for learning new vocabulary and in the second I
explored the tattoo world and built a high fidelity prototype for
the mobile app, Inktastic.

<p>If you prefer audio to text, I take part fairly regularly in the BBC World Service's hour-long Business Matters show, which is a breakfast show (if you're in China) or a late night show (if you're in the UK). Here's <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/sounds/play/w172wmws9zrcks9">one episode</a> in which I discuss Iran sanctions and peaceful protest.</p>
<p>I'm happy to come talk at your school, non-profit or conference if you think I'd be a good fit and it's for a good cause: email me.</p>
You can hear me talk about the Rethinking Economics campaign on the New Economics Foundation's <a href="https://soundcloud.com/weeklyeconomicspodcast/rethinkingeconomics">Weekly Economics Podcast</a>. You can also listen to me discuss Rethinking Economics on BBC Radio 4 with <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b04svjbj">Aditya Chakrabortty</a>, and again with <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b074zgr2">Peter Day</a>.
